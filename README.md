Iâ€™m a computer scientist in Massachusetts with graduate education and 11 years industry experience. Iâ€™ve worked on static program analysis, symbolic execution, compilers and interpreters, fuzz testing, and application security.

I currently work in a team at [Praetorian](https://praetorian.com) that is combining static analysis with machine learning (specifically, large language models) to amplify and augment the capabilities of offensive security operators.

My professional interests focus on making software better, based on the thesis that computers can be leveraged dramatically more than they are to aid in constructing software that works as intended. This involves things like building correct-by-construction libraries, scaling program analyses to real software, applying fuzzing and property-based testing to existing code, and integrating machine-based checks into the software development process. Imagineâ€”software that works!

You can find my resume [here](https://bradfordlarsen.com/files/bradford-larsen-computer-scientist.pdf). Iâ€™ve also written and presented several [peer-reviewed publications](https://bradfordlarsen.com/publications/) over the years.
